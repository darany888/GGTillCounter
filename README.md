A basic React app that lets you count money!

**Link to project:** https://morgandival.github.io/till-counter/

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** React, TypeScript

This app is built in React and TypeScript to help me add up all of my dollarydoos! It uses React states to save the values entered and maintains a running total at the bottom.

## Upgrades:

- [x] Separation of denomination fields into their own child components
- [ ] Better handling of invalid values

## Lessons Learned:

React states are tricky, but it is good to keep in mind that changing the state doesn't force a re-render of the components.

Also, passing props between parent and child components is not as difficult as it looks.
